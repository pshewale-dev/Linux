🟩 Overall Comments on Priorities

> During this year, I effectively managed responsibilities across two key projects — Eneco and Gutor.

In the Eneco project, I contributed to the migration activities and played an active role in Rapid7 vulnerability remediation, successfully resolving around 50 identified vulnerabilities, with another 50 pending due to application dependencies. I ensured all fixes were implemented following security compliance and change management guidelines.

In the Gutor project, I independently managed the entire Linux infrastructure, including patching, daily operational tasks, and implementing security best practices across servers. I ensured system stability, adherence to defined SLAs, and continuous monitoring for performance and compliance.

I consistently prioritized operational excellence, timely completion of change requests, and proactive issue resolution to maintain service reliability across both environments.
